Enhancing a react-based chess game in 10 interesting ways


I enhanced a react-chess page in 10 interesting ways. Here are the ways I did it:
1.	Last move highlight: The squares from the previous moves glow so you know what just happened.
2.	Check glow: The king’s square pulses red when in check.
3.	Capture ring: Legal move indicators change from a dot to a hollow ring border when the target square has an enemy piece in it.
4.	Full move history panel: Every move is logged in algebraic notation, auto-scrolls, and highlights the most recent move.
5.	Captured pieces tray: Each side’s captured material is displayed as piece symbols, with a live material advantage score.
6.	Pawn promotion modal: Instead of auto-queening from pawn, it lets you choose queen, bishop, rook or knight.
7.	10-minute countdown timers: Both players have clocks that start on the first move. The active clock glows gold; under 30 seconds it flashes red.
8.	Sounds effects: Distinct synthesized tones for moves, captures, check, and game-over, with a toggle button to turn it off/on.
9.	AI opponent: Switch to play against a computer that makes capture-preferring random moves, with a “Thinking…” animation while it deliberates.
10.	Board flip + game-over overlay: A double arrow button rotates the entire board and checkmate/draw triggers a dramatic frosted overlay with the result and a restart button.
